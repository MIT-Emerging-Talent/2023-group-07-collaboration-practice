## Introduction

Selection sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. The purpose of this task is to provide a clear and tested implementation of selection sort in Python.

## Implementation

The selection sort algorithm is implemented in the `selection_sort.py` file. The file contains a function named `selectionsort_v1` that takes an array as input and sorts it using the selection sort algorithm.

## Running Tests

To verify the correctness of the implementation, a set of unit tests has been provided. These tests are located in the `test_selection_sort.py` file. To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
python test_selection_sort.py# Selection Sort Implementation
